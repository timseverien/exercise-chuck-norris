# Chuck Norris joke assignment

This repository is an interview assignment.

If this was an real-life project, Iâ€™d probably strive to do the following, depending on project needs:

- Store favorites server-side
- Improve JavaScript-less experience through server-side rendering and use Progressive Enhancement
- Write more automated tests, primarily a bunch of UI tests with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) to catch regressions

## Running the app locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local server
